# Neural-Manifolds-and-Cognitive-Consistency
This repository contains the implementation and supplementary materials for the research paper:
"Neural Manifolds and Cognitive Consistency: A New Approach to Memory Consolidation in Artificial Systems"
by Phuong-Nam Nguyen.

The research introduces a novel mathematical framework combining neural population dynamics, hippocampal sharp wave-ripple (SpWR) generation, and cognitive consistency constraints inspired by Heider’s theory. It leverages low-dimensional manifold representations and balance energy functions to simulate memory consolidation and enhance interpretability in artificial neural networks.
